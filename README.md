# Health outcomes and cost-utility analysis of Psosol vs placebo for patients with plaque psoriasis
Psosol is a new topical ointment which has been developed for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. 
A pragmatical trial was carried out on 455 study participants with plaque psoriasis to investigate the health effects of Psosol versus Placebo. The primary outcomes of interest were severity of psoriasis measured with PASI tool at baseline, 26 weeks and 52 weeks; health utility measured with 5-level EuroQol 3 dimension tool, and resource use for the participants.
The cost-utility is estimated from a healthcare and societal perspective.
